# Front-End Developer Capstone

The Capstone project enables you to demonstrate multiple skills from the Certificate by solving an authentic real-world problem. Each module includes a brief recap of, and links to, content that you have covered in previous courses in this program.

This course will test your knowledge and understanding, and provide you with a platform to show off your new abilities in front-end web development using React. During this course, you will be guided through the process of building an app, combining all the skills and technologies you've learned throughout this program to solve the problem at hand.

On completion of the Capstone project, you’ll have a job-ready portfolio that you can show to recruiters, demonstrate during interviews and impress potential employers.

To complete this course, you will need front-end developer experience. Additionally, it always helps to have a can-do attitude!
